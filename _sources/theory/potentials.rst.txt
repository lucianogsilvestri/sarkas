Potentials
==========
Sarkas supports a variety of potentials both built-in and user defined. Currently the potential functions that are
implemented include

- Coulomb
- Yukawa
- Exact Gradient-corrected Screened Yukawa
- Quantum Statistical Potential
- Moliere
- Lennard Jones

You can read more about each of these potentials in the corresponding sections below.
All the equations will be given in cgs units, however, for easy conversion, we define the charge

.. math::
   \bar{e}^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0},

which when substituted in gives the equivalent mks formula.

Electron parameters and thermodynamic formulas are given in :ref:`here <Electron Properties>`.

Coulomb Potential
-----------------
Two charged particle with charge numbers :math:`Z_a` and :math:`Z_b` interact with each other via the Coulomb potential
given by

.. math::
   V(r) = \frac{Z_{a}Z_b\bar{e}^2}{r}.

where :math:`r` is the distance between ions, :math:`e` is the elementary charge.


Yukawa Potential
----------------
The Yukawa potential, or screened Coulomb potential, is widely used in the plasma community to describe the interactions
of positively charged ions in a uniform background of electrons. The form of the Yukawa potential for two ions of charge
number :math:`Z_a` and :math:`Z_b` is given by

.. math::
   V(r) = \frac{Z_{a} Z_b \bar{e}^2}{r}e^{- r /\lambda_{\textrm{TF}}}, \quad \kappa = \frac{a_{\textrm{ws}}}{\lambda_{\textrm{TF}} }

where :math:`\lambda_{\textrm{TF}}` is the Thomas-Fermi wavelength and :math:`\kappa` is the screening parameter.
In Sarkas :math:`\kappa` can be given as an input or it can be calculated from the
:ref:`Thomas-Fermi Wavelength` formula.

Notice that when :math:`\kappa = 0` we recover the Coulomb Potential.

Exact Gradient-corrected Screened Yukawa Potential
--------------------------------------------------
The Yukawa potential is derived on the assumption that the electron gas behaves as an ideal Fermi gas.
Improvements in this theory can be achieved by considering density gradients and exchange-correlation effects.
Stanton and Murillo :cite:`Stanton2015`, using a DFT formalism, derived an exact-gradient corrected ion pair potential
across a wide range of densities and temperatures.

The exact-gradient screened (EGS) potential introduces new parameters that can be easily calculated from initial inputs.
Density gradient corrections to the free energy functional lead to the first parameter, :math:`\nu`,

.. math::
   \nu = - \frac{3\lambda}{\pi^{3/2}}  \frac{4\pi \bar{e}^2 \beta }{\Lambda_{e}} \frac{d}{d\eta} \mathcal I_{-1/2}(\eta),

where :math:`\lambda` is a correction factor; :math:`\lambda = 1/9` for the true gradient corrected Thomas-Fermi model
and :math:`\lambda = 1` for the traditional von Weissaecker model, :math:`\mathcal I_{-1/2}[\eta_0]` is the
:ref:`Fermi Integral` of order :math:`-1/2`, and :math:`\Lambda_e` is the :ref:`de Broglie wavelength` of the electrons.

In the case :math:`\nu < 1` the EGS potential takes the form

.. math::
   V(r) = \frac{Z_a Z_b \bar{e}^2 }{2r}\left [ ( 1+ \alpha ) e^{-r/\lambda_-} + ( 1 - \alpha) e^{-r/\lambda_+} \right ],

with

.. math::
   \lambda_\pm^2 = \frac{\nu \lambda_{\textrm{TF}}^2}{2b \pm 2b\sqrt{1 - \nu}}, \quad \alpha = \frac{b}{\sqrt{b - \nu}},

where the parameter :math:`b` arises from exchange-correlation contributions, see below.
On the other hand :math:`\nu > 1`, the pair potential has the form

.. math::
   V(r) = \frac{Z_a Z_b \bar{e}^2}{r}\left [ \cos(r/\gamma_-) + \alpha' \sin(r/\gamma_-) \right ] e^{-r/\gamma_+}

with

.. math::
   \gamma_\pm^2 = \frac{\nu\lambda_{\textrm{TF}}^2}{\sqrt{\nu} \pm b}, \quad \alpha' = \frac{b}{\sqrt{\nu - b}}.

Neglect of exchange-correlational effects leads to :math:`b = 1` otherwise

.. math::
   b = 1 - \frac{2}{8} \frac{1}{k_{\textrm{F}}^2 \lambda_{\textrm{TF}}^2 }  \left [ h\left ( \Theta \right ) - 2 \Theta h'(\Theta) \right ]

where :math:`k_{\textrm{F}}` is the Fermi wavenumber and :math:`\Theta = (\beta E_{\textrm{F}})^{-1}` is the electron
:ref:`Degeneracy Parameter` calculated from the :ref:`Fermi Energy`.

.. math::
   h \left ( \Theta \right) = \frac{N(\Theta)}{D(\Theta)}\tanh \left( \Theta^{-1} \right ),

.. math::
   N(\Theta) = 1 + 2.8343\Theta^2 - 0.2151\Theta^3 + 5.2759\Theta^4,

.. math::
   D \left ( \Theta \right ) = 1 + 3.9431\Theta^2 + 7.9138\Theta^4.


Quantum Statistical Potential
-----------------------------
The Quantum Statistical Potential between two charged particles :math:`a,b` used in Sarkas is given by eq.(5)
in :cite:`Glosli2008`

.. math::
   \phi(r) =  \frac{Z_a Z_b \bar{e}^2}{r} \left ( 1 - e^{ - 2\pi r/\Lambda_{ab}}\right ) + \delta_{ae} \delta_{be} k_BT \ln(2) \exp \left \{ - \frac{4 \pi r^2}{\Lambda_{ab}^2 \ln (2)} \right \}

where the screening length :math:`\Lambda_{ab}` is the thermal de Broglie wavelength between the two charges defined as

.. math::
   \Lambda_{ab} = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hbar^2}{\mu_{ab} k_BT}}, \quad  \mu_{ab} = \frac{m_a m_b}{m_a + m_b}

The last term, present only in the interaction between two electrons, accounts for spin-averaged effects.

Note that the de Broglie wavelength is defined differently in :cite:`Hansen1981` hence the factor of :math:`2\pi` in
the exponential. The long range part of the potential is computed using the PPPM algorithm where only the
:math:`1/r` term is split into a short range and long range part.


The choice of this potential is due to its widespread use in the High Energy Density Physics community.
